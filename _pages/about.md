I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Southern California.
My PhD research focuses on leveraging machine learning for symbolic 
regression, enabling the discovery of interpretable mathematical models 
from data. I am also exploring the interplay between generative AI and 
neural architecture search (NAS) to automate and enhance the design of 
innovative neural network architectures. 
I am priviledged to be advised by Professors <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=K4bCJYcAAAAJ">Antonio Ortega</a> and
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5NtH-JcAAAAJ"> Ajitesh Srivastava</a>
for my PhD studies.
